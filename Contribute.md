###Testing

Test your sources with latest version of C++ community plugin. [Write issues](https://github.com/wenns/sonar-cxx/issues) you find from C++ community plugin. Please check always if your [issue](https://github.com/wenns/sonar-cxx/issues?state=open) does not already exist before you create a new one. In case of parsing problems it is mostly helpful to add also example code.
