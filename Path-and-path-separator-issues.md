Setting up the plugin and the build chain the most common issues are path issues at the beginning. Using different build chains, differences on the operating systems and the different SonarQube project types are making the things not easier. On this page you find some hints to get your system up and running.

**General hints**

* Use always slashes (/) in the configuration file as path separator. <br>*Hint: It is also possible to use backslashes but you have to escape it with another backslash (\\ => \\\\) which is worse to read.*
